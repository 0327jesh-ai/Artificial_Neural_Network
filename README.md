# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to solve a real-world prediction problem using supervised learning.  
The model learns patterns from historical data and predicts outcomes with good accuracy and recall.

ANN is used because it can handle non-linear relationships and complex data patterns better than traditional machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Manual prediction using raw data is time-consuming and error-prone.  
The objective of this project is to automate prediction using an ANN model to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.

## Dataset
- Multiple input features
- One target variable
- Numerical and categorical data
- Data split into training and testing sets

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub  

## Project Workflow
1. Data collection  
2. Data preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis  
4. Feature scaling and encoding  
5. Train-test split  
6. ANN model building  
7. Model training  
8. Model evaluation  
9. Prediction  

## ANN Model Details
