Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Project

Project Title
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based Prediction System

Project Overview
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to solve a real-world prediction problem using supervised learning.
The model learns patterns from historical data and predicts the target outcome with good accuracy and recall.
ANN is used because it can handle non-linear relationships and complex data patterns better than traditional models.

Problem Statement
Manual prediction and decision-making using raw data is time-consuming and error-prone.
The objective of this project is to automate prediction using an ANN model to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains multiple input features and one target variable.
Both numerical and categorical features are present.
The data is divided into training and testing sets.

Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras
VS Code
Git and GitHub
